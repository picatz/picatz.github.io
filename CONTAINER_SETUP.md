# Development Container Setup

This project includes VSCode Dev Container configuration to avoid npm platform-specific dependency issues when developing on macOS with containers.

## Quick Start with Dev Containers

1. **Install VSCode Extensions:**
   - [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Open in Container:**
   - Open VSCode in this project directory
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - VSCode will build and open the project in a container

3. **Development:**
   - The dev server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
   - All npm dependencies will be installed automatically
